An attempt to implement type-aligned sequences, as described in [Reflection Without Remorse](http://homepages.cwi.nl/~ploeg/papers/zseq.pdf).

A big hat-tip to Paul Chiusano (@pchiusano) for crucial insight on how to encode the various fold functions in a way that allows for carrying along type information.

Current Status
==============

Don't expect anything to work or even be correct, this is experimental at best.
